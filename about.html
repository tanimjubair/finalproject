        <p class="txt1">We often noticed that there were people who didn't know what smartphone to get and 
        ended up buying a phone they later regretted buying. We wanted to make a difference on their choices.
        That's why we wanted to do something to help people, and this is how Smartphone.News was found. We first 
        began this journey with 3 people and now, we have also gained people who we treat like family who has 
        joined us on this journey to help fellow people. We are so glad!</p></div>
        <div id="div3"><p>Goal</p>
        <p class="txt2">Our goal is to inform our customers about the latest smartphones that is now popular among 
        everyone in this day and age. We don't want our users to get a phone they first thought was good but later regretted buying.</p></div>
        <div id="div4"><p>Impact</p>
        <p class="txt3">People now can use our website to check what phones to get in this year so that they don't regret buying phones they didn't like!</p></div>
